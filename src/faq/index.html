      You'll want to fly into Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL). Google
      Flights will likely be your best bet for exploring flight options. There are a few airlines you'll be able to
      choose from.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">Turkish Airlines</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      A great option if you've got some wiggle room in your dates. Turkish Airlines
      provides <a class="underline hover:font-semibold"
        href="https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/flights/fly-different/touristanbul/what-is-touristanbul/"
        target="_blank">Touristanbul</a>, a free layover service for all international transfer through Istanbul. If
      you fly via Istanbul and have a 6-24 hour layover time, they'll provide transportation to and from historic
      sites & restaurants in Istanbul. A pretty cool way to get some sightseeing in one of Aparajita's favourite
      cities in the world!
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">Ethiopian Airlines</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      A good choice if you're interesting in bumping up to business class -- they
      tend to have good business class fares.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">Air Canada/Air India</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      These two airlines operate codeshare flights and frequently provide direct
      flights to Delhi from Toronto, Montreal, or Vancouver. The direct flights are long (16 hours) but will get you
      there fastest. They'll typically span 7AM Canada time to 11PM India time which can be helpful in managing jet
      lag.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">Egypt Air</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">Similarly to Turkish Airlines, Egypt Air also provides sightseeing day trips if
      your layover allows it.</p>

    <h2 id="dates" class="text-2xl text-red-900">Trip Dates</h2>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">Key dates you'll want to keep in mind (depending on what events you're
      attending):</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="text-sm text-gray-800 flex gap-2">
        <p class="font-bold text-emerald-800 w-20 text-right pr-1 border-r border-emerald-800">Oct 11</p>
        <p>Wedding events for Digvijay & Zahin</p>
      </li>
      <li class="text-sm text-gray-800 flex gap-2">
        <p class="font-bold text-emerald-800 w-20 text-right pr-1 border-r border-emerald-800">Oct 12-14</p>
        <p>Wedding events for Tomas & Aparajita</p>
      </li>
      <li class="text-sm text-gray-800 flex gap-2">
        <p class="font-bold text-emerald-800 w-20 text-right pr-1 border-r border-emerald-800">Oct 15</p>
        <p>Joint reception for both couples</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      We recommend arriving at least 3 days in advance to get over jet lag. You'll probably want to visit for at
      least 10-14 days if you're interested in doing some sightseeing around Delhi & India. Come a bit earlier if
      you want to do some shopping for clothes before any of the wedding events. There are lots of street markets
      you can explore in Delhi. See the <a class="underline hover:font-semibold" href="#clothing">clothing</a> FAQ
      section for more info!
    </p>

    <h2 id="visas" class="text-2xl text-red-900">Visas/Travel Documents</h2>

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">eVisa</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      Canadian passport holders need a visa to visit India. We recommend applying for the 1- or 5-year
      <strong>multiple entry</strong> visa. These will allow you to leave and return (in case you're traveling to
      countries outside of India during your trip) and can be applied for up to 120 days before your trip. While
      there <span class="italic">is</span> a 30-day visa, it can only be applied for 30 days in advance of travel
      and it's <strong class="text-red-900">single entry only</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800 mt-2">
      eVisas can be applied for online (via <a class="underline hover:font-semibold"
        href="https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html" target="_blank">this link</a>) and have had a rapid
      turnaround time (~1 day) for guests who've already applied. There's no guarantee this will remain the case
      however so apply as early as you can!
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">Vaccinations</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      You may need some vaccines to travel to India (or other destinations you're planning to visit). We recommend
      booking a consultation with a local travel immunization clinic: they'll tell you what vaccines are recommended
      based on your intended destinations. Start this process early however since some vaccinations may need
      multiple doses and travel clinics can sometimes have a bit of a backlog.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">Travel Documents Checklist</h3>

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">Weather</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      Delhi in October usually sees highs of 33°C and lows of 21°C. It is worth bringing sweaters/layers -- many
      places in India don't have central heating so it can be cold indoors too. This information comes from
      Aparajita though who is cold at 24°C. For those of you travelling there, southern India tends to be hotter
      than northern India.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">Event Themes/Colours</h3>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      Many Indian wedding events have traditional colours that guests will wear. We've listed the pertinent ones
      below. These are encouraged but not mandatory.

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">Indian Dress</h3>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      Here's a quick overview of the basic types of Indian outfits you could wear. Indian wear isn't
      <i>mandatory</i> but it is encouraged!
    </p>

    <ol class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <li>
        {% imageCard "/assets/img/kurta_men.jpg" "Kurta (Men)" "left" %}
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
          A long, dress-like top worn with big, flowy pants that snug up around the calves. For men, this will
          pretty much be your bread and butter -- Kurta styles range from the day-to-day casual to more formal or
          extravagant.
        </p>
        {% endimageCard %}
      </li>

      <li>
        {% imageCard "/assets/img/kurta_women.jpg" "Kurta (Women)" "right" %}
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
          Similar to the basic kurtas worn by men. Women will often wear kurtas with a <i>chunni</i> (a light
          scarf). They'll also typically have a wider selection of pant types -- loose, snug, flared, etc.
        </p>
        {% endimageCard %}
      </li>

      <li>
        {% imageCard "/assets/img/lehnga.jpg" "Lehnga" "left" %}
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
          A large skirt paired with a short top and worn with a <i>chunni</i> (a light scarf). This ladies' outfit
          is comfy and easy to wear, making it a good choice for nights with dancing.
        </p>
        {% endimageCard %}
      </li>

      <li>
        {% imageCard "/assets/img/saree.jpg" "Saree" "right" %}
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
          A long piece of cloth you wrap around yourself, with a short blouse and petticoat underneath. Sarees can
          be a bit particular to wrap correctly and they'd be tough to manage on the dance floor, but don't let that
          dissuade you! There are tons of people who'd love nothing more than to show you the ropes.
        </p>
        {% endimageCard %}
      </li>

    </ol>

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">Buying Indian Clothes</h3>

    <h4 class="text-sm text-yellow-700">Malls</h4>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      All the big malls in Delhi will have stores where you can buy off the shelf sizes. Common retailers include:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc text-sm text-gray-800 list-inside ml-6">
      <li>Pantaloons</li>
      <li>Global Desi</li>
      <li>Biba's</li>
      <li>Fab India (one of the more authentic/old school options)</li>
      <li>Lifestyle</li>
      <li>Kilol</li>
      <li>Anhoki</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="text-sm text-yellow-700">Markets</h4>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      The street markets of Delhi are great for both sightseeing and finding clothing, souvenirs, etc. These are the
      markets we'd recommend for your visit.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc text-sm text-gray-800 list-inside ml-6">
      <li><strong>Dilli Haat</strong> -- local artisan market in Delhi where you can find handmade items</li>
      <li><strong>Janpath</strong> -- street shopping in Delhi where you can find both Indian and Western clothes,
        and lots of other handcrafts</li>
      <li><strong>Chandni Chowk</strong> -- massive wholesale market in Old Delhi
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
          <li>Well connected by metro but no cars allowed</li>
          <li>Can be a bit difficult to navigate without guidance as it is both huge and crowded</li>
          <li>A fun experience just to visit, but don't bank on finding what you need if you don't know exactly
            where to go</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-red-900">Accommodation</h2>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      During Aparajita & Tomas's wedding days (Oct 12, 13, and 14), we will be providing accommodation & food at the
      Best Western in Gurugram. Before and after these days, you'll want to find accommodation in Delhi or wherever
      you'll be traveling.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">AirBnB</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      AirBnBs in Delhi are a good option, especially if you're looking to share accommodations with other guests.
      Expect to pay around $100-$300 CAD per night for 3-4 bedroom houses.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      Near central Delhi, the neighbourhoods we'd recommend are:
    </p>

    <ul class="text-sm text-gray-800 list-disc list-inside ml-6">
      <li>Connaught Place</li>
      <li>Bengali Market</li>
      <li>Gol Market</li>
      <li>Mandi House</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      In South Delhi, you'll find some artsier neighbourhoods. The ones we'd recommend there are:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-sm text-gray-800 list-disc list-inside ml-6">
      <li>Haus Kauz</li>
      <li>Greater Kailash</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      If you have other neighbourhoods you're interested in, feel free to reach out to us to get the scoop on them.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">Hotels</h3>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      There are a ton of hotel options in Delhi. These will typically be more expensive than AirBnBs but you'll have
      a higher guarantee for a comfortable stay. Expect to pay around $200 CAD per night per room for the nicer
      hotels. We've had good experiences with the following hotels in central Delhi:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-sm text-gray-800 list-disc list-inside ml-6">
      <li>Park Hotel</li>
      <li>Imperial Hotel</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      Again -- if you're looking at other hotels and have any questions, feel free to send them our way.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-red-900">Transportation</h2>

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">Within Delhi</h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      You've got a couple options for mobility within the city.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-sm font-semibold text-yellow-700">Rideshare</h4>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      Rideshare apps (Uber, Ola, Lyft) are all widely available, take credit cards, and are fairly cheap.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-sm font-semibold text-yellow-700">Metro</h4>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      The metro system of Delhi is very well connected but can be a bit crowded, especially at peak
      imes. </p>

    <h4 class="text-sm font-semibold text-yellow-700">Car Rental</h4>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      If you're looking at renting a car, rent one with a driver. It will be hard to find a rental car without a
      driver and you probably don't want to drive in Delhi anyways. Expect to pay about $50 CAD per day for the
      rental & driver.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg text-yellow-700">Outside Delhi</h3>

    <h4 class="text-sm font-bold text-yellow-700">Travel Agent</h4>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      Our recommended travel agent can help with flight, train, hotel, and tour package bookings in India or abroad.
      He offers price matching/beating on prices or deals you find online. Feel free to text him on WhatsApp 24
      hours a day.

    <h4 class="text-sm font-bold text-yellow-700">Trains</h4>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      India has one of the oldest and most well connected train systems. It's worth taking a trip just for the
      experience! Bookings can be made online and in advance (tickets <i>do</i> tend to fill up, so don't wait too
      long). First or second class bookings are not much more expensive and are well worth the additional comfort.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-sm font-bold text-yellow-700">Cars</h4>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      Rental cars (with drivers) are also a good, cheap, and convenient option. 3-4 hour drive trips to e.g., Agra,
      Jaipur are a great candidate for a 1 or 2 day rental.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-sm font-bold text-yellow-700">Flights</h4>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
      You'll be able to find cheap, well connected flights to all major cities from Delhi. Booking well in advance will
      get you the best rates.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-red-900">Money</h2>
    Credit cards will work almost everywhere
    Cash:
    $50/100 us bills will get better conversations - make sure to bring only new series bills if you are
    converting
    (old
    bills before 2006 will not be accepted)
    Convert in the city not the airport
    Additional option: Transfer wise https://wise.com/us/card/
    You can order an international debit card
    Transfer money to it before your trip - and use whereever debit cards are accepted
    Uses the actual conversion rate - no mark ups
    Allows you to withdraw money up to $100 from any atm worldwide at low cost for emergencies

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-red-900">Other tips:</h2>
    Get a local indian SIM card at the airport when you land
    You'll need to show them a passport
    Data plans are way cheaper in India than using roaming (couple dollars a month for 2gb+ of data daily)
    Crime/Pickpocketing
    Pickpocketing is not a huge issue (not anymore than downtown toronto)
    But beggars/ children trying to sell you things, people wanting to take your picture etc will be very
    common -
    if
    you give in to one person, you may be swarmed.
    Some people will try to sell you things or offer to take you to a nice hotel or a shop with the best
    prices.
    Please
    don’t entertain anyone.
    You will get lots of people staring at you (especially if you are blonde)
    Personal space isn't really a thing, especially in crowded places/ queues
    Most people speak English well and will be helpful if you need any support.
